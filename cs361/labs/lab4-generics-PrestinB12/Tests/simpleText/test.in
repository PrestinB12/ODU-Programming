This is a simple spell checker.

It reads a dictionary of properly spelled words from dictionary.txt, then reads plain text from cin and checks each word in it to see if it matches a word from the dictionary. 

Compile and run the program (the executable name is spellcheck).
Even through the dictionary is fairly large, it will be ready to accept text from you pretty quickly.   Type what you like, then signal the end of input by 
using the appropriate key sequence for your operating system: Ctrl-z in Windows, Ctrl-d (at the start of a new line) for most operating systems.

This is not the most sophisticated of spell checkers, but it does ignore upper/lower case differences when comparing words, and it will strip away most punctuation from incoming words as well.
